## 🗂️ Overview

This repository contains my completed SQL workbook from the **JustIT Data Technician Skills Bootcamp**. It demonstrates my understanding of SQL concepts, relational databases, and practical SQL querying techniques using a real-world dataset.

The workbook includes research-based theory, hands-on exercises using the `world_db` sample dataset, and a final applied project that simulates building a database for a small retail business.

## 📌 Topics Covered

### 🧠 Theory-Based SQL & Database Fundamentals

- Primary Keys vs. Foreign Keys
- One-to-One, One-to-Many, and Many-to-Many Relationships
- Relational vs. Non-Relational Databases
- Use cases for different database types

### 🔗 SQL JOIN Types

- INNER JOIN
- LEFT JOIN
- RIGHT JOIN
- FULL OUTER JOIN
- SELF JOIN
- CROSS JOIN

Each join is explained with definitions, real-world applications, and example SQL syntax.

## 🧪 Practical SQL Tasks (Using `world_db`)

Real-world scenario-based SQL queries using a sample database:

| Task | Description |
|------|-------------|
| ✅ Count cities in the USA | Basic `COUNT` query |
| 🌍 Country with highest life expectancy | Using `MAX()` |
| 🗺️ Cities with "New" in the name | `LIKE` clause usage |
| 🔢 Top 10 most populous cities | `ORDER BY` with `LIMIT` |
| 🧮 Cities with population > 2M | `WHERE` filtering |
| 📜 Cities starting with "Be" | Pattern matching |
| 📊 Cities with mid-range population | `BETWEEN` clause |
| 🔠 Cities sorted by name | Alphabetical sorting |
| 🏙️ Most and least populated cities | `MAX()` and `MIN()` |
| 🔁 City name frequency count | `GROUP BY` and `COUNT()` |
| 🌐 Country with highest population | Aggregation queries |
| 🇪🇸 Capital city of Spain | Simple `WHERE` clause |
| 🇪🇺 List of European cities | Region filtering |
| 👥 Average population by country | `GROUP BY` with `AVG()` |
| 🏙️ Capital cities population comparison | Advanced joins |
| 🌾 Countries with low population density | Custom metrics |
| 💰 Cities with high GDP per capita | Economic analysis |
| 📉 Cities ranked 31–40 by population | Pagination with `LIMIT` & `OFFSET` |
